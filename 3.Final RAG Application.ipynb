Be cautious, as some spammers may use fake unsubscribe links to harvest more email addresses.\\n2. **Use a spam filter**: Most email providers, such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, have built-in spam filters. You can also use third-party spam filters like SpamAssassin or SpamSieve.\\n3. **Report spam**: Mark emails as spam or report them to your email provider. This helps them improve their spam detection algorithms.\\n4. **Use a strong password**: Use a unique, complex password for your email account. This will make it harder for spammers to guess or crack your password.\\n5. **Don't respond to spam**: Avoid responding to spam emails, as this can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active and may lead to more spam.\\n6. **Don't click on links or download attachments**: Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown senders. These may contain malware or phishing scams.\\n7. **Use a disposable email address**: Consider using a disposable email address or a temporary email address for online transactions or sign-ups. This can help protect your primary email address from spam.\\n8. **Use a spam-blocking browser extension**: Browser extensions like uBlock Origin, Ghostery,\" response_metadata={'prompt_tokens': 20, 'completion_tokens': 300, 'total_tokens': 320} id='run-414f39e3-0019-477d-99fa-79fd57e49a53-0'\n"
