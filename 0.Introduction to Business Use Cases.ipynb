    "# Business Use Case: ITSM ServiceNow Ticket Resolution Automation with RAG Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case Objective**:  \n",
    "This project aims to streamline the ticket resolution process in ServiceNow by deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The RAG model leverages the existing knowledge base in ServiceNow and Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted on Databricks to provide automated, intelligent responses to new tickets, reducing manual search time and enhancing efficiency.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Industry and Topic of the Use Case\n",
    "The use case is designed for the **IT Service Management (ITSM) industry**, specifically targeting **automated ticket resolution** within the ServiceNow platform. It aims to streamline and enhance ticket resolution for IT support teams, reducing the manual effort required to search through extensive knowledge base articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Problem Statement and Relevance\n",
    "Currently, IT support agents face the challenge of manually searching through knowledge base articles in ServiceNow to resolve tickets. This process is time-consuming, especially with high ticket volumes, as each client generates hundreds or even thousands of tickets. Our RAG model addresses this by providing instant, relevant responses for new tickets, significantly reducing the time agents spend on repetitive issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Approach to Solve the Problem\n",
    "The solution uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** that integrates with ServiceNow to automate ticket responses:\n",
    "   - **Knowledge Retrieval**: When a new ticket is created, our system queries the knowledge base and retrieves relevant documents.\n",
    "   - **Response Generation**: Using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Databricks, the system generates a tailored response based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "   - **ServiceNow Integration**: The response is sent back to ServiceNow and automatically populated in a custom field within the ticket for agent review and final action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Technical Details and Workflow\n",
    "   - **Dataset**: The dataset consists of knowledge base (KB) articles from ServiceNow for various clients.\n",
    "   - **Model**: A RAG model deployed on Databricks processes the ticket information and generates responses.\n",
    "   - **Workflow**: \n",
    "      - The custom action in ServiceNow Flow Designer sends new ticket details to the Databricks LLM endpoint.\n",
    "      - The LLM retrieves relevant KB articles and generates a response.\n",
    "      - The response is returned to ServiceNow and added to the ticketâ€™s custom field.\n",
    "   - **Diagram Explanation**:![GenAI Usecase diagram](GenAI Usecase diagram.drawio.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Benefits of the Solution\n",
    "   - **Time Savings**: Even a one-minute reduction per ticket accumulates to significant time savings across high ticket volumes.\n",
    "   - **Improved Efficiency**: By automating responses for repetitive issues, agents can focus on more complex tickets.\n",
    "   - **Data Relevance**: The model leverages existing knowledge base data, ensuring responses align with established procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Codebase and Components\n",
    "   - **Code**: We use Python code to implement the RAG model, ServiceNow components, and Databricks integration.\n",
    "   - **Components**:\n",
    "      - **ServiceNow**: Custom action in Flow Designer for triggering the model.\n",
    "      - **Databricks**: Hosting the LLM and managing vector database queries.\n",
    "      - **RAG Model**: Retrieves relevant KB documents and generates contextually accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Conclusion and Future Plans\n",
    "   - **Conclusion**: The RAG model offers a scalable, automated approach for ticket resolution, reducing time and improving response accuracy.\n",
    "   - **Future Enhancements**:\n",
    "      - **Real-Time Learning**: Retraining the model as new tickets are created to improve response accuracy over time.\n",
    "      - **Multi-Language Support**: Extending the model to handle tickets in various languages for global use.\n",
    "      - **Chatbot Integration**: Evolving the system to support direct user interactions, allowing for self-service ticket resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach not only addresses current challenges but also offers a roadmap for further enhancements that can scale to meet evolving needs."
